# copyWebsite

This website was created in order to improve my bootstrap and html skills. It is a fully responsive webpage that works on all screen widths and heights, and has a few css animations as well as formatting to make it look clean. It has both a mobile and desktop version

The website is posted [here](https://michael-shu.github.io/copyWebsite/)

and is based upon this [website](https://myresourceslp.resourcesify.com/lp#/af/6259971d0a8300ea68b4d87c?sr=1&s1=1020280d51d6230001d9a5d92fe7a9&s2=&s3=&fn=%7Bfirst%7D&ln=%7Blast%7D&em=%7Bemail%7D&z=%7Bzip%7D&utm_source=r4m_1_5ceed0f80fef7d05ef33449a&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=196)
